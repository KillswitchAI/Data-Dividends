Data Dividends Calculator
Open blueprint: how much is your data actually worth?
You own your weight.
You own your wage.
I threw this together in a single night.
No company, no team, no funding.
Just a guy with a phone, a shelter bed, and the idea that platforms shouldn’t get to train AI on your life without paying you.
Here’s everything—
UI wireframes
pricing logic
HTML version you can copy-paste and host in 5 minutes
full dev spec for React/Firebase
Build it.
Fork it.
Steal it.
Because if one of us ships this?
They all have to follow.

## Why I Built This

I designed this while I was homeless.

Not as a thought experiment. As a necessity.

I was creating valuable ideas (100K+ people read them), but the platforms paid me nothing.

Millions of creators, researchers, patients—we're all generating data that trains billion-dollar AI models.

And we get NOTHING.

This project builds the system that should already exist.

If you think this matters, help me build it.

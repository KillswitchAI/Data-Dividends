## 🎯 Start Here (Non-Technical)

**What is this?**  
Right now, AI companies make billions training on your data—posts, videos, health info—and pay you $0. This project builds the infrastructure to change that.

**How it works (simple version):**
1. You opt in to share specific data (always your choice)
2. AI calculates what it's worth based on scarcity + utility
3. You get paid automatically—transparent, auditable, fair
4. Think "Spotify royalties for your digital labor"

**Why this matters:**
The skydiving blood pressure example isn't hypothetical. Rare, valuable data should earn premium rates. Common data should still earn something. Right now? You earn nothing.

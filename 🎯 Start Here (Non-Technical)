The Problem: AI companies train on your data (posts, videos, health info). They make billions. You get $0.
The Solution: Pay people fairly for their data—automatically, transparently, based on value.
How It Works:
	1.	You choose what to share (always opt-in)
	2.	AI calculates value (rare data = more money)
	3.	You get paid (transparent, auditable)
	4.	Example: Morning scroll = $0.05. Skydiving blood pressure = $500.
This is the infrastructure to make that real.
